# Lets-interact
I am creating this repository to interact with other developers to discuss project ideas, common discussions about stuffs.  I would really appreciate good content.


<q>Hey, if you have any interesting ideas to discuss, put it in the issues section and we can take the discussion further.</q>

Thanks for taking your time to look into this.
