# Lets-interact
I am creating this repository to interact with other developers to discuss project ideas, common discussions about stuffs.  I would really appreciate good content.


> Hey, if you have any interesting ideas to discuss, put it in the issues section and we can take the discussion further.

Thanks for taking your time to look into this.


### Ideas
1. A automated data analysis engine which accepts data in various formats and responds with various types of analytics. <br>
2. A image processing application targetted at processing images of medicines. It would be helpful for many elder people through `image -> text -> speech process`, especially in reading the labels on such stripes. [link to repo](https://github.com/ahtrahdis7/taskit)

###### Feel free to add. Make a PR. Let's get to work.
